# Semester Project 1 - Futeum

Live site deployed at https://futeum.kyrre.dev/


Futeum is a community science museum website that I created for my semester project at my university, Noroff. It provides a platform for the museum to share the latest news, events, and exhibits with the public. The website was designed with a focus on user experience, featuring a clean, modern design and easy navigation.

## Key Features:

- Latest news and updates from the museum
- Information about current and upcoming exhibits
- Event calendar and registration system
- Contact information and directions to the museum
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on all devices
